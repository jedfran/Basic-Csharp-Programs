## BlackJack Game
I made a full working Black Jack/Twenty One game using basic understanding of C#. It mimics the the full game, it includes the features "Hit", "Stay", "Leave" etc,.
User is given the choice to enter as much money as they want and bet as much in their balance.
User is given 2 random cards and have to make a smart decision based on the random cards that the Dealer was dealt to get Black Jack!

## Basic Student Database
This project is still in progress but it uses the MVC web application and utilizes Entity Framework 6.
The project was made using the Code-First approach.
It gives the user the ability to create/delete/edit the object "Student".

## Car Insurance
This project is an MVC web application that mimics a car insurance website. 
The user inputs information about their car and their history with car and calculates the qoute base on some business logic.
An Admin Page is also made for the staff to see the details of the quotes that has been issued.

## Newsletter Subscription
This project is an MVC web application that mimics a subscription service.
This newsletter service allows the user to sign-up to the subscription service by entering their Personal Info.
An admin page is also made for the staff to unsubscribe an customer who is willing to cancel their subscription.
